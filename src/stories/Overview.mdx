# InsightBoard UI

Welcome to the **InsightBoard UI component library**. This documentation provides a unified design system to help you build consistent, accessible, and scalable interfaces. It includes **foundations**, **components**, and **best practices** that ensure your product delivers a cohesive user experience.

The system is built with **accessibility and performance** at its core. Every decision, from color contrast to semantic markup, is made to support inclusive and efficient user experiences. Whether you’re building for desktop or mobile, InsightBoard UI adapts to deliver clarity and usability across devices.

## **Foundations: guidelines and visual styles**

Our foundations establish the **core building blocks** of the design system. They ensure clarity, accessibility, and consistency across every product surface. Explore the principles below to understand how we use **color, typography, and spacing** to create structure and meaning.

Flexibility is another key principle. Components and tokens are designed to be **adaptable and extendable**, allowing teams to meet specific product needs without reinventing the wheel. With thoughtful defaults and scalable patterns, the system ensures long-term maintainability as projects evolve.

## **Components: flexible building blocks**

Our components are **primitives designed for reuse and flexibility**. They adapt to different contexts while maintaining consistency across applications. Explore how core elements like **buttons, cards, and forms** enable teams to design and develop faster without sacrificing usability or accessibility.

Consistency is achieved through **design tokens** such as colors, typography, and spacing. These tokens ensure that when you use a button or a card, they not only look consistent across pages but also respond predictably to changes in themes or brand identity updates.
Flexibility comes from the ability to **customize and extend components** without breaking their foundation. Whether you need a primary button, a ghost button, or a link-styled button, you can use the same base component and adjust it through variants and props, ensuring scalability for growing product needs.

Our components are **tested and documented** to reduce guesswork during implementation. Storybook examples, usage guidelines, and best practices are provided to help designers and developers collaborate more effectively and speed up decision-making during the design and development process.
