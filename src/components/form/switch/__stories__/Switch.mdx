    # Switch

    A component for toggling between two states, typically "on" and "off". It is commonly used in forms and settings where a binary choice is required.

      sourcePath={`components/form/switch`} 
    />

    ## **Purpose and Context**

    The `Switch` component is designed to provide users with a clear and intuitive way to toggle between two options. It is often used in scenarios such as enabling/disabling features, setting preferences, and controlling settings.

    -  **Checked**: Indicates whether the switch is in the "on" position.
    -  **Disabled**: Disables the switch, preventing user interaction.
    -  **Label**: The text label associated with the switch, providing context for the choice.

    In addition to these, the `Switch` component inherits all standard HTML input attributes, allowing for extensive customization and flexibility. This includes attributes such as:
    -  `name`: Groups switches together, allowing only one to be selected at a time.
    -  `value`: The value associated with the switch when selected.
    -  `onChange`: Handles changes to the selection state.
    -  `required`: Marks the switch as required for form submission.

    ## **Examples**

    ### **Basic Switch**

    A simple switch with a label.

    <Canvas>
      <Canvas.Story>
        <Story of={Switch.Default} />
      </Canvas.Story>

      <Canvas.Source>
        <Source className="my-0!" dark code={`
          import { Switch } from '@clera-ui/form'

          const SwitchExample = () => {
            return <Switch 
              label="Enable feature"
              name="featureToggle"
              value="enabled"
            />
          }

          export default SwitchExample
        `} />
      </Canvas.Source>

    ## **FAQ**
    ### **What are the different states of a switch?**
    A switch can be in various states such as checked (on), unchecked (off), disabled, and focused.

    <Canvas.Source>
      <Source className="my-0!" dark code={`
        <Switch 
          label="Enable feature"
          name="featureToggle"
          value="enabled"
          checked
          disabled
        />
      `} />
    </Canvas.Source>

    ### **How do I group multiple switches?**
    Use the same `name` attribute for all switches in a group to ensure only one can be selected at a time.

    <Canvas.Source>
      <Source className="my-0!" dark code={`
        <Switch 
          label="Option 1"
          name="options"
          value="option1"
        />
        
        <Switch 
          label="Option 2"
          name="options"
          value="option2"
        />
      `} />
    </Canvas.Source>

    ### **How do I make a switch required?**
    Add the `required` attribute to the switch input to make it mandatory for form submission.

    <Canvas.Source>
      <Source className="my-0!" dark code={`
        <Switch 
          label="Accept terms"
          name="terms"
          value="accepted"
          required
        />
      `} />
    </Canvas.Source>
